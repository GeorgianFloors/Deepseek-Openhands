## Key Differences from My Previous Mistake

‚ùå **What I Did Wrong Before:**
- Created a simplified server that replaced OpenHands
- Removed all the powerful agent capabilities
- Only provided basic monitoring

‚úÖ **What This Actually Does:**
- **Preserves ALL OpenHands functionality**
- **Adds monitoring as an enhancement**
- **Runs the actual OpenHands server**
- **Keeps all tools and agents**

## Verification
After running, you should see:
- OpenHands server on port 3000 with full functionality
- Monitoring dashboard on port 7778
- Access to all OpenHands tools and agents
- Real-time activity tracking

## Troubleshooting
If you encounter issues:
1. Make sure all dependencies are installed: `pip install -e .`
2. Check ports 3000 and 7778 are available
3. Verify the OpenHands API responds at `http://localhost:3000/health`
